        <h2>🌟 A New Era for Adult Performers</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>FanGigs</strong>, a platform built specifically for adult content creators, talents, and industry professionals. 
          If you're a model looking to connect with legitimate producers, find paid gigs, or collaborate with creators, you've just found your new home base.
        </p>
        <p>
          FanGigs was created with <strong>safety, opportunity, and freedom</strong> in mind. We believe models deserve a professional space where they can showcase 
          their skills, control their image, and get booked—without spam, scams, or sleazy gatekeeping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s break down how to get started, what makes FanGigs different, and how you can grow your career step-by-step.
        </p>

        <h2>👣 Step 1: Join and Set Up Your Profile</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Signing up is free</strong> and takes only a few minutes. But your profile is your ticket to bookings, so give it some love.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full name or stage name (whatever you want displayed)</li>
          <li>Profile picture (headshot) – clear, professional or casual</li>
          <li>Two full-body shots</li>
          <li>Birthday, location, gender, orientation, camera experience</li>
          <li>Short bio – show your vibe and what you’re open to</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          💡 <em>Pro Tip: Make your profile public if you want producers to find you. Otherwise, they’ll only see it if you apply for a job.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>💼 Step 2: Apply for Gigs That Match You</h2>
        <p>
          Once your profile is ready, explore the <strong>Find Work</strong> page. You’ll see casting calls from verified producers and creators:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Actors and actresses for scenes</li>
          <li>Content collaborations</li>
          <li>Photo shoots or livestreams</li>
          <li>Fetish or niche roles</li>
          <li>Remote gigs (e.g., cam or solo content)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use filters to find what fits. See something you like? Click <strong>Apply</strong> — your profile goes straight to the producer.
        </p>

        <h2>✅ Step 3: Get Noticed (and Get Picked)</h2>
        <p>Producers will see:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your pictures</li>
          <li>Your bio and personal stats</li>
          <li>Your availability (feature coming soon!)</li>
          <li>A direct way to message you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Keep your profile updated</strong> and professional. Models who do this get way more attention and bookings.
        </p>

        <h2>💌 Step 4: Build Relationships and Get Repeat Work</h2>
        <p>
          FanGigs isn’t just about one-time gigs. It’s about building lasting connections:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Producers can save your profile</li>
          <li>You can chat directly to negotiate</li>
          <li>They might post many gigs and come back to you again</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🔐 Your Privacy and Safety Matter</h2>
        <p>We take your safety seriously:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only verified producers can post or hire</li>
          <li>Choose whether your profile is public or private</li>
          <li>No real name or personal info required</li>
          <li>Report/block features are always available</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use your stage name and stay in control. Nobody sees anything unless you let them.
        </p>

        <h2>💸 Money Talk: Getting Paid</h2>
        <p>
          Pay info is usually visible in each listing. If marked "confidential," just message them and ask.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Flat rate jobs</li>
          <li>Content trades</li>
          <li>Rev-share agreements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Always feel empowered to ask for what you’re worth. Respectful negotiation is encouraged here.
        </p>

        <h2>🗺️ Travel Plans? Let Them Know</h2>
        <p>
          With the new <strong>Creator Travel Map</strong>, you’ll soon be able to list the cities you’ll be in and when. 
          Producers in those cities can reach out to you ahead of time.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perfect for touring talent</li>
          <li>Helpful if you’re open to new cities or collabs</li>
          <li>Get booked before you even land</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🔗 More Features Coming Soon</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Anonymous reviews & ratings</li>
          <li>Verified talent badges</li>
          <li>Custom video requests (content commission system)</li>
          <li>Analytics: see who viewed your profile</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🙋 FAQs</h2>
        <p><strong>Is this like Model Mayhem or OnlyFans?</strong><br />Not really. FanGigs is a job marketplace — not a content host or subscription platform.</p>
        <p><strong>Do I need prior experience?</strong><br />Nope! Some listings are beginner-friendly. Just be honest.</p>
        <p><strong>What if I also post jobs?</strong><br />Great! You can act as both talent and producer with one account.</p>

        <h2>💖 Final Thoughts: This Is Your Platform</h2>
        <p>
          FanGigs is created by people who get it. We’re not a corporate middleman, we’re the bridge between real models and real opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’re more than a performer — you’re a brand, a business, a pro. And you deserve a platform that respects that.
        </p>
        <p>
          So set up your profile, apply to a few jobs, and get ready. The new era of adult casting is here — and you’re at the center of it.
